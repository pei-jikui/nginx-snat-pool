support multiple hosts (snat pool) for all kinds of *_bind directives.

For example of proxy_bind directive:

proxy_bind $var_1 $var_2  <ip_1> ....

The parameters following the directive could be mixture of variables and ip addresses.
They will be used as the snat pool of the outgoing connections to upstream servers.

1) So far, the algorithm of choosing the right upstream server is roundrobin which is quit simple and straightforward.  
We need to further polish the upstream server choosing algorithm.

2) If there are some nonlocal ip address in the pool list, 
we need to use the nginx native "transparent" parameter for this purpose. 
At the same time, we need to configure the iptable or
the policy routing as well.
